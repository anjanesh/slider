This is a vanilla JavaScript based image slider.

This my sound like "another image slider" but this is a bit unlike others with respect to navigation. There are two more navigation buttons to fast scroll left and right.

I inititially wrote this code in 2011 based on jQuery 1.6.4. I edited it to remove jQuery but did not clean up the code for readability. I hope to do it soon.
